    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <p>This was one of the best trips i've taken in a while. It was my girlfriend & I
        who spontaneously decided to take a trip to the Statue of Liberty National Monument.
        We took a ferry from Battery Park in New York City to Liberty Island. The views of the
        Manhattan skyline from the ferry were breathtaking. Once we arrived at Liberty Island,
        we were greeted by the iconic statue. 
    </p>
    <p> We spent hours exploring the island, taking
        pictures, and learning about the history of the statue. We even climbed to the crown
        of the statue, which offered a stunning view of the harbor. The experience was
        unforgettable, and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting New York City.
